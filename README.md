This was a project created by my team and I at Queen's University's Hackathon, QHacks17 from February 3rd to 5th.

The "hack" or project is a Google Chrome extension that aims to reduce image sizes and resolution ever so slighty while magniying the need to allow for faster webpage load times and lower internet bandwidth usage. By sending image urls to a server, created on NodeJS, and then resizing and sending images back to the webpage to be displayed, the file size of the image can be reduced to 10% of it original.
Although the extension is not complete, my fellow hackers and I learned a great deal through implemention of various new techniques and software languages when creating this hackathon project.

The project aims to demonstrate how not all things need to be viewed at their maximum resolution and sizes, by compromising a little bit
of image quality, one can experience much faster load times and be able to reduce the cache needed to open up pages on the internet. By
dynamically changing out the original photo with the transformed photo of the same size, the webpage appears identical to its original
view, only with the benefit of being loaded faster and reducing the internet bandwidth needed.
