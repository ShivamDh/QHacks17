This was a project created by my team and I at Queens University's Hackathon, QHacks.

The project is a Google Chrome extension that aims to reduce image sizes and resolution ever so slighty to allow for faster
webpage load times and lower internet bandwidth usage. By sending image urls to a server, created on NodeJS, and then resizing
and sending this image back to the webpage to be displayed, the file size of the image can be reduced to 10% of it original.
Although the extension is not complete, my fellow hackers and I learned a great deal and implemented various new techniques when 
creating this hackathon project. The project aims to demonstrate how not all things need to be viewed at their maximum resolution and 
sizes, by compromising a little bit of image quality, one can experience much faster load times and be able to reduce the cache needed
to open up pages on the internet.
